                <h5>About me</h5><br>
                <p> Kyle Warford is a recently graduated student of the University of 
                    East Anglia. He has studied a mix of Computer Science, and Mathematics,
                    gaining a 2:1 Degree with honors in Mathematics. The experience of two 
                    different courses that both require a similar way of thinking and problem solving
                    provides Kyle a broader scope of subject understanding.
                </p>
                <p> Kyle is fueled by his passion of self improvement, and has studied
                    many programming languages, Python, HTML, C++, to name a few. And his inquiring
                    mind is always working towards his next project. He is currently studying
                    within the Netmatters Coalition Scheme system, with his end goal to work
                    within a large multi-national business.

                        <p>During my time at university, I created python files that contain
                            classes that store information into turbines, as well as store turbines into windfarms.
                            This is an example of a function that on input of air density,
                            wind velocity, downstream velocity, and upstream velocity,
                            returns the maximum power output of a wind turbine.
